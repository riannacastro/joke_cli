# JokeCLI

Welcome to the Joksters CLI! This CLI allows you to hear a two-part joke from one of the two categories that you choose. When requested to see the list of jokes, you will be able to choose between either a Pun or a Programming joke. After picking the category, the first part of the joke will be displayed. You will be prompted to press "?" to view the second part of the joke.
